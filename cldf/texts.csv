muserz01,muserz01,"These two texts were recorded by Geoffrey Haig with a speaker called Miheme (NK01), who grew up in a village near Muş. The speaker had left Turkey approximately ten years previously and had since settled in Germany. The recordings were made in Miheme's allotment garden in Kiel, North Germany, in the company of his wife and another friend of the family. Geoffrey Haig made a long series of recordings with Miheme, most of which have been transcribed and translated by Geoffrey Haig with the assistance of native speakers.
The stories are Miheme's renderings of traditional Kurdish folkloric texts. Although not a trained storyteller, Miheme relished the opportunity to tell these stories, most of which he was recalling from childhood memories. He had no qualms about embellishing them in various ways when his memory failed him. His Kurdish is quite strongly influenced by Turkish, his main language of communication over the past two decades, but he is undoubtedly a fluent speaker of Kurmanji.",Geoffrey Haig and Maria Vollmer and Hanna Thiele,"Haig, Geoffrey & Vollmer, Maria & Thiele, Hanna. 2019.

muserz02,muserz02,"This text was recorded by Abdullah Incekan in 2002 in Essen, Germany; the speaker is his grandmother Güllü Tunç (NK02), who was visiting Germany at the time. The atmosphere was relaxed; a number of family members including small children were present during the recordings. The speaker is a monolingual Kurmanji speaker who has spent her lifetime in a village of the region Tekman, south of Erzurum. The text was transcribed by Abdullah Incekan and Geoffrey Haig, and translated by Geoffrey Haig.
As regards content, this text is undubitably related to the well-known fairy tale Cinderella, and contains key motifs such as the evil stepmother, the slipper, the prince and so on, but the latter part of the story seems to stem from a different source, and at times the narrative lacks coherence.",Geoffrey Haig and Maria Vollmer and Hanna Thiele,"Haig, Geoffrey & Vollmer, Maria & Thiele, Hanna. 2019.
