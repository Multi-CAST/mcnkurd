    "description": "**Northern Kurdish** ([nort2641](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/nort2641)), also known as Kurmanj\u00ee, is a Northwest Iranian language spoken in eastern Turkey, Iraq, Syria, and parts of western Iran. The three texts recorded here are traditional narratives, from a female and a male speaker who grew up near the townships of Erzurum and Mu\u0161, respectively.\n\nThe texts were recorded in Germany in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and subsequently transcribed, translated, and annotated for Multi-CAST by Geoffrey Haig, Abdullah Incekan, Hanna Thiele, and Maria Vollmer. A [description of the language](MediaTable#cldf:Haig2018_Northern-Kurdish_Kurmanji.pdf) can be found in [Haig (2018)](Source#cldf:haig2018).\n\nThe texts in this corpus (version 2207) also make up a part of the [Northern Kurdish data set](https://doreco.huma-num.fr/languages/nort2641) in [DoReCo](https://doreco.huma-num.fr/), which has been time-aligned at the phone level.",
